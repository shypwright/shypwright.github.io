The three of them love the thrill of green-slate projects; architecting the entire stack to automated integration testing leveraging the cloud. Combining Vinay's heavy experience in full stack, Monikka's solid back-end engineering, and Bo's low-level sprinkled with math together with substantial management experience, the result is a team that can realize any idea by solid scalable production grade code. And they have fun doing it.</p>
