Since then, she has cultivated the skills and figured she might as well get a degree in her passion from SF state for which she had alraedy been working professionally as. She has been known to write the cleanest code while producing oodles of it which should be an oxymoron. Wherever she works, she is always the rising star. She spends her spare time helping out women in tech. Her primary role will lead developer, manager and architect.

Bo fell backwards into software developement and hasn't looked back. He's a tree-hugger volunteering to save endangered species and loves motorcycles. His primary role, will be lead developer, manager and math guru.
